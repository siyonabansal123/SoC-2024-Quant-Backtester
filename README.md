# SoC-2024-Quant-Backtester

 	
This project will run on 3 tracks of which one is web dev the other one being researching trading strategies to trade and third is quant dev[only for python proficients]. To give an idea this will be a complete end to end system for researchers for finding alphas. I will be taking sessions to introduce you to quant trading, building trading models and then with the learnings you will need to build models, we will use python to build out trading strategies and our backtester. 
 
 Track 1 - Full stack development [ host this quantlab, Refer to Timeline for detailed learning outcomes ]
 Track 2 - Building trading models ( I will take sessions on step by step on how to build strategy then you will need to build your idea)
 
 Track 3 -
 Only for ones looking to go one step further into Quant Dev can choose any-
 - Building risk management module [Python, Will add modules to existing quantlab]/
 - Building Portfolio optimization module [Python, Will add modules to existing quantlab]/
 - Building FinML library [Python + ML + Finance]
