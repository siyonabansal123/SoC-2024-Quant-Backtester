# SoC-2024-Quant-Backtester

The overall framework will consist of three main components:
## Data Pre-processing: 
This module will be responsible for preparing and cleaning the data, ensuring it is in the proper format for trading simulations.
## Trading Execution: 
A class that will instantiate and execute trading strategies based on the pre-processed data. This component should be able to handle different types of trading strategies and ensure accurate execution of trades.
## Post-Trade Analysis: 
After trading simulation, this module will analyse the returns and performance of the strategy. It will calculate various metrics such as the Sharpe ratio, and generate visualisations to help in assessing the strategyâ€™s effectiveness.
